Task-01. "BUILD A TEMPERATURE CONVERSION PROGRAM" <br>
Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original              unit of measurement. It tre should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display am the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a                 temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs. <br>

Task-04. "IMPLEMENT A SUDOKU SOLVER" <br>
Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.
It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.
